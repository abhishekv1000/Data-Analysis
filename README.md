# eCommerce Data Science Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains the solution for the eCommerce Data Science assignment. The task involves:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset.
- **Building a Lookalike Model** to recommend similar customers.
- **Customer Segmentation** using clustering techniques.

## Tasks

### Task 1: EDA & Business Insights
- Perform data cleaning and visualization (monthly sales, top-selling products, sales by region).
- Derive 5 business insights based on the analysis.

**Files:**
- `FirstName_LastName_EDA.ipynb` (Code for EDA)
- `FirstName_LastName_EDA.pdf` (Business insights)

### Task 2: Lookalike Model
- Build a model that recommends 3 similar customers based on transaction history and profile.
- Output is stored in `FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.csv`.

**Files:**
- `FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.ipynb` (Code for Lookalike model)
- `FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.csv` (Similar customers for the first 20)

### Task 3: Customer Segmentation
- Perform clustering to segment customers using KMeans.
- Calculate clustering metrics (e.g., DB Index).

**Files:**
- `FirstName_LastName_Clustering.ipynb` (Code for segmentation)
- `FirstName_LastName_Clustering.pdf` (Clustering results)

## Requirements

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `sklearn`
- `numpy`

### Install libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn numpy
